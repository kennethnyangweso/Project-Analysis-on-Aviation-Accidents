# DSF-PHASE-1-PROJECT
PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project outlines the analysis based on a dataset provided by the National Safety and Transport Board. 
It relays data on aviation accidents over the past decades (1962-2022). 

BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
Over the past decades, the rates of aviation accidents have been influenced by various factors, such as aircraft make and model. 
Understanding how these factors correlate provides actionable insights into improving aviation safety, identifying design flaws, and implementing better operational protocols. 
This analysis can guide manufacturers and stakeholders to make data-driven decisions for risk regulation and enhance safety.

OBJECTIVES
Main objective:
To analyze and interpret accident trends over the past decades

Specific objectives:
Identify factors that have led to aviation accidents based on aircraft parameters such as make, model, their correlation, and aircraft category
Identify factors that have led to aviation accidents region-wise based on countries and accidents recorded in various regions
How various makes have made an impact on various based on injuries recorded from each make
Identify the trends yearly over the past decades based on aviation accidents

MY ANALYSIS
The dataset is based on trends of aviation accidents done by the National Transport and Safety Board(NTSB). Here is the dataset 

This analysis will be based on the top key factors that influence aviation accidents these parameters are:
Top 10 aircraft makes with the most aviation accidents
Top 15 aircraft models with the most aviation accidents
Top 5 aircraft categories with the most aviation accidents
Top 5 main Broad phase of flight with the most accidents
Top 5 countries with the most aviation accidents
Top 5 makes with total number of injuries recorded
Top 3 aircraft makes and models and how their correlation have impacted aviation accidents
The trend of aviation accidents over the past decades

Here are some of the visualizations I used for my analysis:

CONCLUSION

Some of the finding from my analysis are:
 From my analysis, it is evident that the Cessna and Piper have the most number of accidents with each having a record exceeding 10,000. 
 I went further with my analysis by checking how this can be influenced by the model. 
 From my analysis, the models that record the most accidents are the 152, 172, and 172N models with more than 1000 aviation accidents. 
 These key models are widely used by the Cessna and Piper companies hence contributing to these aviation accidents.
 
 From my analysis the phase of flight where accidents occur is unknown/unspecified. 
 With reference from my previous based on aircraft make and aircraft make my research has given insights that most of these aircrafts are light-weighted aircrafts and have trouble during the climb phase due errors such a bank-angle which was unspecified in my analysis. 
 Hence we can assume that the most recorded accident is during the climb phase since most aircraft makes with most accidents are quite sensitive when it comes to this phase of flight.
 
Finally from my analysis it is evident that there was a rapid increase of aviation accidents as of early 1980s. 
However as time progress we can see a rapid decrease in aviation accidents. This may be brought about by factors such as;
technological advancements such as the autopilot, adequate aviation personel trainings  such as ATC training and regular aircraft maintenance and inspections.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Here are some of the recommendations based on my analysis and findings
I would recommendation on the purchase of aircraft make with less aviation accidents such as the Robinson, Bellanca and Hughes
Secondly, advise companies to reduce the use and manufacture of makes with most aviation accidents
I would also recommend on regular aircraft maintenance and inspection on aircraft with most aviation accidents as some of these accidents may be brought by poor maintenance
Finally I would also recommend that civil aviation companies carry out frequent trainings on aircraft personnel such as the Air Traffic Controllers, aircraft pilots and flight engineers

SUMMARY
In summary based on my analysis, finding and recommendations that led to the success of this analysis we can see strategies that have been used to reduce these aviation accidents.
